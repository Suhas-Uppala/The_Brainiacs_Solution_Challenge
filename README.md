## Setup and run guide

### Clone repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Suhas-Uppala/The_Brainiacs_Solution_Challenge.git
cd "The_Brainiacs_Solution Challenge"
```

### Running the Frontend (SportAI Flutter App)
#### 1. Navigate to the Flutter App folder:
```bash
cd SportAI
```

#### 2. Install Flutter dependencies:
```bash
flutter pub get
```

#### 3. Run the Application (make sure your emulator/device is ready):
```bash
flutter run
```

### Running the Backend Services
- Our backend is split into two modules: SportAI RAG (for AI-driven coaching) and SportAI Posture (for real-time posture analysis). Both use Python.

### a. SportAI RAG
1. Navigate to the SportAI RAG folder:
```bash
cd "../SportAI RAG"
```
2. Set up a Python virtual environment (Windows Commands):
```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```
3. Install the required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4. Build the FAISS vector store:
```bash
python build_vector_store.py
```
5. Start the AI coaching service:
```bash
python api.py
```

### b. SportAI Posture
1. Navigate to the SportAI Posture folder:
```bash
cd "../SportAI Posture"
```
2. Set up a Python virtual environment (Windows Commands):
```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```
3. Install the required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4. Start the posture analysis service:
```bash
python api.py
```
## Testing & Quality Assurance
### Frontend Tests (from the SportAI directory):
```bash
flutter test
```
### Backend API Tests (in each backend folder):
```bash
pytest
```
